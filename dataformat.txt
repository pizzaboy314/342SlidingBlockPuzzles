EX: lvl1.data, lvl2.data, lvl3.data, lvl4.data, lvl5.data

-- File content format --
Line 1: size of grid
Line 2: location and specs for the Z piece. The Z piece line always goes first.
Line 3+: location and specs for the rest of the pieces

The format of a piece line is: ROW COLUMN HEIGHT WIDTH TAG
ROW (starting at 1, not 0): which row the piece starts at
COLUMN (starting at 1, not 0): which column the piece starts at
HEIGHT: how many rows the piece takes up
WIDTH: how many colums the piece takes up
TAG: a tag string as an identifier for the piece. The Z piece always has tag "z".
Otherwise tags run in order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f g ......etc. Stick to a single character.
